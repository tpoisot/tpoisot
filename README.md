:wave: Hi! I'm Timothée Poisot (he/him)

✨ I am an associate professor of Quantitative & Computational Ecologist at the Université de Montréal - https://poisotlab.io/      

:question: What does it means?   

:exclamation: I use machine learning and data science tools to solve ecological problems, with a sustained interest for network ecology and the prediction of species interactions. I particularly enjoy the challenging puzzle of making inference from sparse _and_ incomplete data, and to deal with multiple sources of uncertainty.

🦠 I build tools for viral discovery with the [VERENA](http://viralemergence.org) consortium   
🎓 I teach computational skills to biodiversity scientists with [BIOS²](https://bios2.usherbrooke.ca/)   
📈 I work on AI applied to biodiversity forecasting with the [GEOBON](https://geobon.org/) secretariat   
🖥️ I serve on the scientific board of [Compute Québec](https://www.calculquebec.ca/en/)  
⚛️ I serve of the steering committee of MonarQ, Québec's quantum computer for public research   
🗞️ I have [a newsletter](https://buttondown.email/ctrl-alt-tim)! It's about ecology, time management, and education

💬 Reach out on [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/ctrlalttim.bsky.social) or at `firstname.lastname@umontreal.ca`   
🤸 I am *very* passionate about [https://julialang.org/](JuliaLang), ecological networks, and making sense of data on biodiversity   
🗨️ I am available to give workshops and training sessions on computational ecology, and sometimes for data consulting
